This was a fairly straightforward approach. I utilized multiple past assignments.
Step1) Find CCC this took some tuning and is still not great near the end of the video my frames detector loses the CCC in a few frames as I had to 
        tune pretty aggressively to remove false positives as they would not allow pose to be ran correctly
Step 2) Find the pose this was easy as I had this code broken out into functions in the past assignment
Step 3) Map the image, this was the hardest as I had a hard time using the poly mask as I had not completed Lab 5
        I eventually got it to work and was able to first remove the area from CCC 1-4 in the target image and then use a bitwise_or to fill the mask/target image
        This worked because I made a matching projection image from my new image and resize it to match my target image size
Step 4) Display all appropriate info to the screen this was again easy as it was code used in past assignments
